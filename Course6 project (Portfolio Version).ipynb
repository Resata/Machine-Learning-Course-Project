As a step to improve the model's performance, we can categorize customers based on the tip percent (for eg: cheap, almost generous, generous, very generous) and see if using this new feature can improve the model's performance.\n","We can also create a new column 'holiday' based on the day column to see is the tip amount is affected by whether the day is a holiday or not. Another feature that can be transformed is the trip distance which can be categorized to short, medium, or long.\n","  \n","4.
